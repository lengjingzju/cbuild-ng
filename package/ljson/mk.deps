HOMEPAGE         = https://github.com/lengjingzju/json
DESCRIPTION      = LJSON is a C implemented JSON library that is much faster than cJSON and substantially faster \
                   than RapidJSON, it is currently the fastest general-purpose JSON library. LJSON supports JSON \
                   parsing, printing and editing, provides DOM and SAX APIs, and I/O supports string and file, \
                   it fully supports the test cases of nativejson-benchmark. By default, LJSON uses the personally \
                   developed ldouble algorithm to print double to string. Compared with the standard library, \
                   it may only be the 15th decimal place difference. It is currently the fastest double to string \
                   algorithm; users can also choose the personally optimized grisu2 algorithm or dragonbox algorithm.
